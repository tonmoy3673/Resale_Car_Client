            <p>Certified used cars are pre-owned vehicles that have undergone a thorough inspection and met specific criteria set by the manufacturer or a certified program. These programs are typically offered by dealerships or manufacturers and are designed to provide peace of mind to buyers.</p>
            <p>
            One of the key advantages of buying a certified used car is the warranty it comes with. Unlike regular used cars, certified vehicles often come with an extended warranty that offers additional coverage beyond the original factory warranty. This warranty can provide reassurance against unexpected repairs and potentially save the buyer from costly expenses.
